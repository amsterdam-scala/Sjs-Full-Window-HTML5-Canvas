Scala Full Window HTML Canvas
=============================
To create a resizeable full window HTML Canvas Scala.js application
 * Use the included index.html and swfc.css files for the application web page
 * Rename and package MainAppTemplate.scala to be the main class of your application
 * Edit index.html to give it the correct page title, paths to the JS dependencies and compiled Scala.js application,
   and main application class name
 * Implement the paint method in the main application class to perform the logic of painting the application initially
   and on each resize
 * Implement the rest of the application logic in the main method of the main application class
